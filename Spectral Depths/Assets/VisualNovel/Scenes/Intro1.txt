BigDialogueBox "I am dragged awake by an uneasy silence.{l} Diminished only slightly by the comforting hum of machines.{l} The stone-cold floor presses against my back.{l} While my gaze fixes upon the smoke-clouded ceiling"

The familiar smell of chemicals still lingers in the air
Despite the medley of aromas that had infiltrated

I lay on the floor, unable to move
And unable to remember anything
Yet for some reason, it didn't bother me at all
At that moment, contentment was found in watching time go by

After a while, I sense a motion to my left
And so I call out to it
In the distance, I hear a quiet voice respond
A Pleasant Voice

A Pleasant Voice "Chuckle* Your senses are still as sharp as ever."
And I thought today would be the day I could finally give you a jump scare.

BigDialogueBox "She slowly shuffles towards me, lying down by my side"
I try to take a glance at the strange person but my head would not move
She starts reminiscing about things I've no recollection of

A Pleasant Voice "...chopped up five batches of chives and..."

BigDialogueBox "Names that were alien to me"

A Pleasant Voice "...took JuJu by the leg and dragged..."

BigDialogueBox "and jokes I didn't understand"

A Pleasant Voice "...because he was unbalanced"
"HAHAHAHAH, you get it?..."

BigDialogueBox "She sounded so happy that I couldn't bring myself to ruin the moment"
I just laid there and listened
occaisionally responding vaguely to keep the conversation going
occaisionally sensing tinges of sadness in her words

A Pleasant Voice "Looking back, everyone sure had a lot of fun with your crazy ideas."
So Director, lets make even more fun memories together with everyone, ok?

BigDialogueBox "I could almost imagine the big grin on her face as she said that"
It made me wish I could've responded with a yes

BigDialogueBox "..."

A Pleasant Voice "What's wrong?"
You're even less talkative than usual today.

Me "Sorry"
I don't remember anything
...
What your name?

A Pleasant Voice "..."
.....
.......
Pftttttt
HAHAHAHAAAHA
You may have lost your memories, but you haven't changed one bit
Still never speaking up for yourself
You probably felt bad so you didn't stop me
I must've sounded crazy to you
HAHAAHHAHA
You can call me....{a}Carrie

Me "Then Carrie,{a} can you tell me about myself?"

Carrie "You betcha, we have...{a} more than enough time."
