In times long past, Earth had seen the rise and fall of many great empires.{a} Long ages of prosperity and peace were common under these empires{a}, but none were as long or as prosperous as The Golden Age brough to humanity by the Haoran Empire.{a} Under the leadership of three geniuses, a new Energy Source was discovered and The Spire was built to harvest the resource.{a} The Spire was the cumulation of humanity's understanding of the world.{a} In just a few centuries, the energy became an essential part of everyday life.{a} Powerful corporations recognized this fact and sought to replicate The Spire for profit.{a} Having only known prosperity, they were blind to the consequences of their own recklessness.{a} Their imperfect creations became unstable and caused series of energy waves to ripple across Earth.

{a}Half the world was turned into a desolate wasteland, ending The Golden Age{a} and Energy Sickness, an uncurable disease spread throughout the world.{a} Infection Rate: 99.99%{a}, Death Rate: 100%.{a} Only two ways were discovered to have shown to slow down the progression of the disease:{a} Proximity to The Spire and metallic objects.{a} Only those at the top of society could live near The Spire and so wealth, power, and greed were worshipped.{a} Those unfortunate to be at the bottom, resorted to replacing organic body parts with mechanical ones to prolong their lifespan.
The world is cruel{wa 2} and someone's going to need to change this.{c}
