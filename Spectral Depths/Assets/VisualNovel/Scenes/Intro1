Narrator "I am dragged awake by an uneasy silence"
diminished only slightly by the comforting humming of machines
The stone-cold floor presses against my back
As I stare up at the smoke-clouded ceiling

The familiar smell of chemicals still lingers in the air
Despite the potluck of scents that had invaded

I lay on the floor, unable to move
And unable to remember anything
Yet for some reason, it didn't bother me at all
At that moment, I was content with watching time go by

After a while, I sense a motion to my left
And so I call out to it
In the distance, I hear a quiet voice respond
A Pleasant Voice

A Pleasant Voice "Chuckle* Your perception is still as sharp as ever."
And I thought today would be the day I could finally give you a jump scare.

Narrator "She slowly shuffles towards me, lying down by my side"
I try to take a glance at the strange person but my head would not move
She starts reminiscing about things I've no recollection of
Names that were Alien to me, and jokes I didn't understand
She sounded so happy that I couldn't bring myself to interrupt
Eventually, she stopped




A Pleasant Voice "
